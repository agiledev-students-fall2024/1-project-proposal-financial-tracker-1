# Project Proposal

### Project title

**Financial Tracker**

### What and why?

I would like to propose a financial tracker that manages spendings, sets budgets, and provides assistance for individuals' financial needs. By creating a space to track finances, people will not need to be concerned about how much they are spending (daily, weekly, yearly, etc.) and saving. In today's society, many are not on top of their finances and are constantly struggling to remember where their personal spendings go, indicating the lack of financial literacy and management. This contains great importance because having control over finances will allow you to plan your future better and achieve any financial goals. 

### For whom?

The financial tracker is suited for small businesses, businessman, families, students, and others who oversee their own money. Small businesses may track how much profit they are making (what goes in and out of their business), while families can manage their household income and spendings. Students, specifically college students, have to pay for tutition or take out loans for their education. This service assists them to keep track of where the money is ending up. 

### How?

From an end-user's perspective, the financial tracker system will do the following: 

*   **User Identification**: Users are required to register/log-in to view the account on their finances. This provides security for their profile and any private information. 
*   **Financial Situation Indicators**: Once inside the application, users will be able to view the value of their net worth, income, and any money they currently have. There will be a feature along with it that allows them to enter their spendings, investments, and more through categorization. This will be added to an organized spendings list that monitors the amount of money that has been used. 
*   **Alerts, Real-Time Financial Reports and Data Vizualization**: Alerts and reports will remind users when their finances are not in the best situation and whenever they reach the set budget limits while data vizualization services a better understanding for them to understand their financial circumstances. 
*   **Personalized Financial Counseling**: If users would like to contact a professional planner to discuss any of their questions, concerns, or future plans. 

### Scope

This proposal can be undertaken by a group of programmers in one semester due to the incorporation of front-end development, back-end development, data management/visualization, and security. There are many features and details, varying from simple calculations to complex data information, that need to be implemented for the system to be successful.
